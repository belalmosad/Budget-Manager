## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript

## How data is stored/retrieved in this application?
The application relies on JavaScript's `window` property: `localStorage` as the method of storing/retrieving data.

## Application Demo
### Homepage

### Form for adding expense item

### When user tries to add expense that costs more than remaining money.

## Description of data in `localStorage`

1. `localStorage.data`: associative array contains all the expenses data displayed in the table. **key** is item ID number, while **value** is an array that contains:
    - Expense category (Grocery, rent, transportation, ..etc).
    - Description.
    - Cost
    - ID number

2. `localStorage.nextID`: numeric value that assigns an ID number for the record.

3. `localStorage.totalBudget`: contains the total budget that the user can spend. The value is entered and edited by the user.

4. `localStorage.totalExpenses`: contains the total value of the expenses, when the user enters an expense item (e.g. car rent that costs 50$), the cost value (i.e. 50$) is added to `localStorage.totalExpenses`.

5. `localStorage.remainingBudget`: contains the left amount of money after adding expenses. This value cannot be negative value, if the user attempts to add an expense item that costs more than the `remainingBudget` value, the item will not be added, and the user will be informed he cannot add these expenses.


## Problems, Issues, and Solutions

- ### **Problem 1**: How to represent/store/retrieve data?
    - #### **Solution**: By using `localStorage` property as a mock/tiny database. For larger scale app I Would use database instead.

- ### **Problem 2**: How to refer to each expense record for delete/update that *specific* record?
    - #### **Solution**: In the case of using a database, we usually use a primary key as a unique identifier. But in this case (using `localStorage`) I assigned an ID for each item (using `localStorage.nextID` property).

- ### **Problem 3**: When click on the update âœŽ button, a new form page should open, how to pass the data of a specific record to the update form page so that the form is filled with the original data to be updated?
    - #### **Solution**: Pass the data of the record in `localStorage` as follows:
        #### In the page that contains all records
        ```
        localStorage.setItem("updateItemData", JSON.stringify(dataArr));
        ``` 
        #### In the update form page
        ```
        localStorage.getItem("updateItemData");
        ```
        Then, after finishing the update process, 
        ```
        localStorage.removeItem("updateItemData");
        ```
- ### **Problem 4**: When trying to add new feature (quantity of each record), I faced alot of problems editing my code .. it was a miss.
    - **Solution**: Realizing that the code was not clean enough to add new feature easily. So, I started learning practices of writing clean code and Design patterns in JavaScript (Not Implemented yet). But as an initial step, I separated dealing with data in a separate interface `DataModel`, and relied on an object `ExpenseItem` instead of just an array.

- ### **Problem 5**: Adding Responsiveness for better Experience in other devices.
    - **Solution**: Using css property `display: flex` and wrapping it in class: `row`, then using it for through the other components.
